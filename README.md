# sample-oh-my-aidlcops

**Make AIDLC reliable.** OMA is a Claude Code · Kiro plugin marketplace that turns
the [AIDLC methodology](https://devfloor9.github.io/engineering-playbook/docs/aidlc/methodology)'s
two reliability axes — **Ontology Engineering** (correctness) and **Harness
Engineering** (safety) — into installable plugins, with **AIDLC Workflows** as the
process spine and **AgenticOps** closing the feedback loop back into the ontology.

## The easy button for Ontology + Harness Engineering

OMA's goal is a **one-install easy button**: add the marketplace, install the
plugins, and the AIDLC methodology's two reliability axes — Ontology Engineering
and Harness Engineering — are active in Claude Code or Kiro without hand-rolling
any schemas, policies, or hooks. You approve at checkpoints; agents do the rest.

```text
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-oh-my-aidlcops
/plugin install ai-infra@oh-my-aidlcops agenticops@oh-my-aidlcops aidlc@oh-my-aidlcops modernization@oh-my-aidlcops
# → typed ontology + harness DSL + AWS hosted MCP wiring, ready to use
```

### Where this is going — an enterprise operations open toolset

OMA is being built into an **open toolset for enterprise operations automation**.
The trajectory:

1. **Today** — Ontology + Harness Engineering as installable plugins, AWS Hosted
   MCP (awslabs/mcp) as the default runtime data layer, AgenticOps closing the
   feedback loop.
2. **Next** — deeper AWS Hosted MCP coverage plus first-class **DevOps agent**
   and **Security agent** integrations, so deploy, observability, and security
   review run as governed agents inside the same approval model.
3. **The promise** — install a few plugins and get enterprise-grade operations
   automation that is auditable, policy-gated, and harness-constrained by
   default — not a bespoke platform you assemble yourself.

## What's new in v0.4

Release `v0.4.0-preview.1` repositions the project around the reliability
dual-axis and renames plugins for clarity, building on the enterprise ontology +
harness surface introduced in v0.3:

- **Reliability dual-axis docs** — dedicated Ontology Engineering (correctness)
  and Harness Engineering (safety) pages mapping each axis to its OMA
  implementation, with honest partial/roadmap status for harness patterns.
- **Plugin renames** — `agentic-platform → ai-infra`, and
  `aidlc-inception` + `aidlc-construction` merged into a single `aidlc` plugin.
- **8 ontology entities** — `Agent`, `Skill`, `Deployment`, `Incident`,
  `Budget`, `Risk`, plus `Spec` and `ADR` (Draft 2020-12) closing the
  Phase-1 → Construction traceability chain.
- **Harness DSL v2** — optional `workflows` (DAG), `telemetry` (OpenTelemetry),
  `policies` (OPA/Rego), `metadata.labels`. `version: 1` files compile unchanged.
- **Enterprise gates** — `oma doctor --enterprise` (8 probes),
  `oma compile --strict-enterprise`, `oma validate <entity.yaml>`, and JSON-L
  audit events via `python -m tools.oma_audit.append`.

Full details in [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) and on the
[Releases page](https://aws-samples.github.io/sample-oh-my-aidlcops/releases).

## What is OMA?

`oh-my-aidlcops` (OMA) is the sibling project of
[oh-my-claudecode](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-claudecode) (OMC).
Where OMC orchestrates generic Claude Code workflows, OMA specializes in making
the **AIDLC loop** — Inception → Construction → Operations — *reliable enough to
run with agents*.

### The problem: agentic AIDLC fails on reliability, not capability

The [AIDLC methodology](https://devfloor9.github.io/engineering-playbook/docs/aidlc/methodology)
identifies that AI-driven development breaks down in three recurring ways, and
none of them are about model quality:

- **Hallucination & drift** — concepts mean different things across prompts and
  sessions, so handoffs only work because a human re-interprets them.
- **Runaway execution** — without architectural limits an agent loop can fire
  hundreds of retries (the methodology's fintech case: 847 retries, ~$2,200, a
  3-hour outage) before anyone notices.
- **Self-grading** — the agent that wrote the code also writes the tests, so its
  own blind spots survive verification.

The methodology answers these with a **reliability dual-axis**: *Ontology
Engineering* guarantees the **correctness** of what agents produce (the WHAT/WHEN),
and *Harness Engineering* enforces the **safety** of how they execute (the HOW).
OMA is the installable implementation of that dual-axis on AWS.

### The three pillars OMA installs

| Methodology axis | Guarantees | OMA implementation | Entry point |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Ontology Engineering** | Correctness (WHAT · WHEN) | 8 JSON-Schema entities in `schemas/ontology/`, `oma validate`, schema-evolution rules | `/oma:inception`, `oma validate` |
| **Harness Engineering** | Safety (HOW) | Harness DSL v2 (`policies`/OPA, `telemetry`), `oma compile --strict-enterprise`, pinned MCP, sandboxed budget eval | `oma doctor --enterprise`, `oma compile` |
| **AgenticOps (Outer Loop)** | Living ontology | `self-improving-loop`, `continuous-eval`, `incident-response` feeding operational signal back into the ontology | `/oma:agenticops`, `/oma:self-improving` |

**AIDLC Workflows** — the AWS-official
[awslabs/aidlc-workflows](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows) 3-phase loop —
is the *process spine* these pillars hang on. OMA contributes only `*.opt-in.md`
extensions to it and never forks the core. The result: AIDLC stops being "design
and build, then hope," and becomes a lifecycle where every artifact is a validated
ontology document and every agent action runs inside a harness.

## Who is this for?

- Platform engineers building agentic AI on AWS EKS.
- Teams running LLM/agent workloads who want AIDLC to cover *operations*, not
  just design and construction.
- Teams modernizing legacy workloads onto AWS using a repeatable 6R workflow.
- Claude Code or Kiro users who want a drop-in marketplace rather than
  hand-rolling skills.

## Plugins

| Plugin | What it does | Example skills |
|---|---|---|
| **`agentic-platform`** | Build & run the Agentic AI Platform on EKS | `agentic-eks-bootstrap`, `vllm-serving-setup`, `inference-gateway-routing`, `langfuse-observability`, `gpu-resource-management`, `ai-gateway-guardrails` |
| **`agenticops`** | Operate it with agents | `self-improving-loop`, `autopilot-deploy`, `incident-response`, `continuous-eval`, `cost-governance`, `audit-trail`, `anomaly-detection`, `root-cause-analysis`, `automated-remediation`, `slo-management`, `predictive-scaling` |
| **`aidlc-inception`** | AIDLC Phase 1 extensions | `structured-intake`, `requirements-analysis`, `user-stories`, `workflow-planning` |
| **`aidlc-construction`** | AIDLC Phase 2 extensions | `component-design`, `code-generation`, `test-strategy`, `risk-discovery`, `quality-gates` |

## Tier-0 workflows

OMA inherits the Tier-0 pattern from OMC — high-leverage workflows you invoke
once and let run, with human approval only at checkpoints.

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/oma:autopilot` | Full AIDLC loop autopilot (Inception → Construction → Operations) |
| `/oma:aidlc-loop` | Single-feature AIDLC one-pass |
| `/oma:agenticops` | Operations mode (continuous-eval + incident-response + cost-governance) |
| `/oma:self-improving` | Feedback loop — traces (via your opt-in trace MCP) to skill/prompt improvement PR |
| `/oma:platform-bootstrap` | 5-checkpoint Agentic AI Platform build on EKS |
| `/oma:modernize` | Legacy workload modernization (6R decision → cutover) |
| `/oma:review` | AIDLC artifact review (ADR, spec, design, PR) |
| `/oma:cancel` | Terminate active Tier-0 mode |

## Install

### ⚡ One-liner (Tech Preview — recommended)

`install.sh` downloads the pinned release tarball, extracts to `~/.oma`, and
symlinks `~/.local/bin/oma`. `oma setup` then writes a project profile,
seeds the ontology, installs the plugins, and runs `oma doctor` to confirm
the environment.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/sample-oh-my-aidlcops/v0.4.0-preview.1/install.sh | bash
cd my-project
oma setup
oma doctor
```

See the [Easy Button docs](https://aws-samples.github.io/sample-oh-my-aidlcops/docs/easy-button)
for what `oma setup` writes, how the 12 doctor probes work, and how the
ontology + harness DSL get enforced at runtime.

> **Tech Preview notice** — `v0.4.0-preview.1` treats `profile.yaml` v1, the 8
> ontology schemas, and Harness DSL v2 as stable. Everything else (CLI UX, doctor
> report shape) may evolve before GA. See [Support Policy](https://aws-samples.github.io/sample-oh-my-aidlcops/docs/support-policy).

### Claude Code (native marketplace — Claude Code 2.0+)

```bash
claude
```

Inside the Claude Code session:

```text
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-oh-my-aidlcops
/plugin install ai-infra@oh-my-aidlcops
/plugin install agenticops@oh-my-aidlcops
/plugin install aidlc@oh-my-aidlcops
/plugin install modernization@oh-my-aidlcops
/plugin list
```

> `/plugin install` accepts a single plugin id per invocation. Pasting the
> six lines above lets Claude Code run them sequentially. For a shell
> one-liner, use `claude <<'EOF' ... EOF` to feed the commands via stdin.

### Claude Code (manual script — legacy / MCP-only)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-oh-my-aidlcops
bash sample-oh-my-aidlcops/scripts/install/claude.sh
```

> The manual script creates `~/.claude/plugins/` symlinks and merges MCP
> servers + hooks into `settings.json`. **On Claude Code 2.0+ this alone
> does NOT register plugins with `/plugin list`.** Use it only for
> legacy 1.x environments, offline CI, or when you want to wire MCP
> servers without activating the marketplace.

### Kiro

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-oh-my-aidlcops
bash sample-oh-my-aidlcops/scripts/install/kiro.sh
```

### Initialize `.omao/` in your project

```bash
cd <your-project>
bash <path-to-oma>/scripts/init-omao.sh
```

### AIDLC extensions (opt-in)

```bash
bash scripts/install/aidlc-extensions.sh
# Clones awslabs/aidlc-workflows into ~/.aidlc and symlinks OMA's opt-in extensions.
```

### Quick start — enterprise flags

After `oma setup`, four commands are worth exercising on day one:

```bash
# 1. Diagnostic only — 8 probes, never changes state.
oma doctor --enterprise
# → [doctor:enterprise] 8 probes OK (0 warnings)

# 2. Enforce the gate — rejects DSL v1, missing approval_chain, legacy
#    string artifacts, and unclassified Risks.
oma compile --strict-enterprise
# → compiled ai-infra: plugins/ai-infra/.mcp.json ...

# 3. Validate an ontology entity (Spec / ADR / Deployment / Incident /
#    Budget / Risk / Agent / Skill). OPA is shelled out when declared.
oma validate path/to/deployment.yaml
# → [oma validate] path/to/deployment.yaml: schema OK

# 4. Print the execution plan for a DSL v2 workflow (stub: no runtime yet).
oma run-workflow ai-infra platform-bootstrap
# → execution order: preflight -> provision -> verify
```

Adoption is one flag away — every enterprise field is optional
until you opt in via `--strict-enterprise`. See
[Enterprise readiness](https://aws-samples.github.io/sample-oh-my-aidlcops/docs/enterprise-readiness)
for the phased adoption checklist.

### Compliance frameworks

OMA aligns ontology entities with four authoritative references so
audit-facing conversations work without invented vocabulary:

| Framework | Where it lands in OMA | Docs |
|---|---|---|
| [Model Context Protocol v1.0](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) | `Agent.mcp_uri` (canonical MCP server URI) | [Foundation](https://aws-samples.github.io/sample-oh-my-aidlcops/docs/ontology) |
| [SLSA v1.1 Provenance](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.1/) | `Deployment.artifact.{digest,provenance_uri,signing}` | [SLSA provenance](https://aws-samples.github.io/sample-oh-my-aidlcops/docs/compliance/slsa-provenance) |
| [NIST AI RMF (AI 100-1)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/NIST.AI.100-1.pdf) | `Risk.nist_ai_rmf_subcategory`, `AuditEvent.compliance.nist_ai_rmf` | [NIST AI RMF mapping](https://aws-samples.github.io/sample-oh-my-aidlcops/docs/compliance/nist-ai-rmf) |
| [OWASP Top 10 for LLM Apps](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/) | `Risk.owasp_llm_top10_id` (LLM01..LLM10) | [OWASP LLM Top 10 mapping](https://aws-samples.github.io/sample-oh-my-aidlcops/docs/compliance/owasp-llm-top10) |

OpenTelemetry (traces/metrics/logs) and FinOps Framework cost categories
feed the DSL v2 `telemetry` and `Budget` surfaces respectively.

### Liked it? Give the repo a Star

If OMA was useful, a ⭐ on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-oh-my-aidlcops)
helps us prioritize maintenance and keeps release notifications flowing
to you. It is entirely optional — nothing in the CLI changes based on
your star status.

## Foundation: ontology + harness DSL

OMA plugins rest on two shared layers:

1. **Ontology** (`ontology/`, `schemas/ontology/`) — eight JSON Schemas that
   define the vocabulary every plugin and skill agrees on: `Agent`, `Skill`,
   `Deployment`, `Incident`, `Budget`, `Risk`, plus `Spec` and `ADR`. A handoff
   between Construction and Operations is no longer a prose description; it is a
   validated `Deployment` document. See [ontology/README.md](./ontology/README.md)
   and [ontology/glossary.md](./ontology/glossary.md).
2. **Harness DSL** (`schemas/harness/dsl.schema.json`, `tools/oma_compile/`) —
   one `<plugin>.oma.yaml` per plugin is the single source of agents, MCP
   servers, hooks, and triggers. `python -m tools.oma_compile` translates it
   to the native `.mcp.json` and `kiro-agents/*.agent.json` files that Claude
   Code and Kiro already consume, so marketplace installs stay unchanged.

```
<plugin>.oma.yaml  ──(oma-compile)──▶  .mcp.json
                                   ▶  kiro-agents/<agent>.agent.json
                                   ▶  .omao/triggers.json  (merged across plugins)
```

CI (`.github/workflows/oma-foundation.yml`) validates every schema fixture and
runs `oma-compile --check` to reject drift between DSL sources and committed
native files.

## Security posture

This repository ships with conservative defaults. A few things are worth
calling out before you use it in production:

- **MCP servers are pinned** to exact PyPI versions in every `.mcp.json` and
  `kiro-agents/*.agent.json`. `@latest` is not used anywhere — a compromised
  upstream release cannot silently land alongside AWS credentials.
- **EKS MCP is read-only by default.** The bundled Kiro agent profile does
  *not* pass `--allow-write` or `--allow-sensitive-data-access` to
  `awslabs.eks-mcp-server`. Add them explicitly when you need to provision
  or mutate EKS resources, and audit that change.
- **IAM is least-privilege.** The `langfuse-observability` skill uses a
  customer-managed policy scoped to the Langfuse bucket ARN; AWS managed
  `AmazonS3FullAccess` (`s3:*` account-wide) is explicitly rejected with a
  "Bad Example" block in the skill.
- **`budget.yaml` expressions are sandboxed.** The `cost-governance` skill
  evaluates `rule["when"]` via [`simpleeval`](https://pypi.org/project/simpleeval/)
  (AST walker, zero builtins, zero callables). A documented Bad Example shows
  why Python `eval()` on a user-editable file is an RCE vector.
- **Session state stays local.** `.omao/state/`, `.omao/plans/`, `.omao/logs/`,
  `.omao/notepad.md`, and `.omao/project-memory.json` are gitignored —
  `audit-trail` captures prompts verbatim (PII, approver identity, SOC2
  retention content) and must never leave the machine.
- **Hooks require a real JSON encoder.** `hooks/session-start.sh` uses `jq`
  (with `python3` / `python` as ordered fallbacks) and exits non-zero rather
  than emitting shell-interpolated JSON, preventing state-file injection into
  the session context.
