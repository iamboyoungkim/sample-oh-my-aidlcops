`oh-my-aidlcops` (OMA) is a **Claude Code · Kiro plugin marketplace** that turns the two reliability axes of the [AIDLC methodology](https://devfloor9.github.io/engineering-playbook/docs/aidlc/methodology) — **Ontology Engineering** (correctness) and **Harness Engineering** (safety) — into installable plugins on AWS. AWS's official AIDLC Workflows serve as the process spine, and AgenticOps closes the feedback loop back into the ontology. OMA is a sister project of [oh-my-claudecode](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-claudecode) (OMC), specializing its orchestration philosophy in making the AIDLC loop reliable enough to run with agents.

## One-Paragraph Summary

Agentic AIDLC fails on reliability, not capability — hallucination/drift, runaway execution, and self-grading. The methodology answers with a **reliability dual-axis**: Ontology Engineering guarantees the correctness of what agents produce (WHAT/WHEN), and Harness Engineering enforces the safety of how they execute (HOW). OMA is the installable implementation of that dual-axis: a one-install **easy button** that activates a typed ontology, a harness DSL, and AWS Hosted MCP wiring without hand-rolling schemas, policies, or hooks. Users approve at checkpoints; agents handle diagnosis, proposal, and execution.

## Where this is going — an enterprise operations open toolset

OMA is being built into an **open toolset for enterprise operations automation**:

1. **Today** — Ontology + Harness Engineering as installable plugins, AWS Hosted MCP (awslabs/mcp) as the default runtime data layer, AgenticOps closing the Outer Loop.
2. **Next** — deeper AWS Hosted MCP coverage plus first-class **DevOps agent** and **Security agent** integrations, so deploy, observability, and security review run as governed agents inside the same Tier-0 approval model.
3. **The promise** — install a few plugins and get enterprise-grade operations automation that is auditable, policy-gated, and harness-constrained by default — a drop-in open toolset, not a bespoke platform you assemble yourself.

Detailed plugin definitions are in the repository root at [`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`](https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-oh-my-aidlcops/blob/main/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json).

## Tier-0 Workflows

Tier-0 workflows are high-leverage operations that start an entire flow with a single invocation and require user approval only at checkpoints.

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/oma:autopilot` | Autonomous AIDLC full-loop execution (Inception → Construction → Operations) |
| `/oma:aidlc-loop` | Single feature AIDLC one-pass |
| `/oma:inception` | Phase 1 only |
| `/oma:construction` | Phase 2 only |
| `/oma:agenticops` | Operations mode (continuous-eval + incident-response + cost-governance running in parallel) |
| `/oma:self-improving` | Langfuse traces → skill/prompt improvement PR feedback loop |
| `/oma:platform-bootstrap` | Agentic AI Platform 5-checkpoint bootstrap on EKS |
| `/oma:review` | AIDLC artifact review (ADR, spec, design, PR) |
| `/oma:cancel` | Terminate active Tier-0 mode |

See [Tier-0 Workflows](./tier-0-workflows.md) for detailed invocation of each command.

```

The diagram above shows how the AIDLC 3-phase structure closes via an agent-driven feedback loop. Observability data from the Operations phase (Langfuse traces, Prometheus metrics, CloudWatch logs) flows back through `self-improving-loop` to automatically improve Construction-phase skills and prompts. Note that trace-based feedback requires an external Langfuse instance plus a trace MCP server configured in the profile (`observability.trace_mcp`).

## Supported Harnesses (Dual Harness)

OMA operates identically across two agent harnesses.

- **Claude Code** — Install via native `/plugin marketplace add` or `bash scripts/install/claude.sh` (or `oma setup`). Integrates into `.claude/plugins/`, `.claude/commands/oma/`, and `.claude/settings.json`.
- **Kiro** — Install via `bash scripts/install/kiro.sh` (or select `harness=kiro` in `oma setup`). Symlinks `SKILL.md` to `.kiro/skills/` and steering to `.kiro/steering/`.
- **Shared state** — The `.omao/` directory at project root is harness-agnostic; both harnesses read and write the same files.
- **Recommended path** — Single `oma setup` command handles profile + seed ontology + plugin installation all at once. See [Easy Button](./easy-button.md) for details.

Installation and configuration for each harness are covered in [Claude Code Setup](./claude-code-setup.md) and [Kiro Setup](./kiro-setup.md).

## Target Users

- **Platform engineers** building and operating Agentic AI platforms on AWS EKS
- **LLM and agent operations teams** seeking to cover planning through operations with AIDLC
- **Claude Code or Kiro users** who prefer validated drop-in marketplace plugins over building custom skills
